style.css holds style information that sets font, font size, colors, etc, and is externally referenced inside the HTML page.

This HTML page named 'index.html' is a web page I developed that utilizes Bing Maps (Virtual Earth Maps).  VE Classes, Methods, and Properties were used to customize the map extent, URL hyperlinks, image sources, pushpins (flags), and the baselayer.

The references used to create this page include:  Bing Maps AJAX Control Class Reference (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429565.aspx) and W3Schools HTML/CSS reference to help build the web page (http://w3schools.com).
